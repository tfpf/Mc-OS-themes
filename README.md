# Teal-Sea: Light Style and Icon Themes
This is a fork of
[paullinuxthemer/Mc-OS-themes](https://github.com/paullinuxthemer/Mc-OS-themes)
wherein I have customised a style theme from the same repository and the icon
theme from
[zayronxio/Os-Catalina-icons](https://github.com/zayronxio/Os-Catalina-icons)
for the Xfce desktop environment with teal (or sea green) as the main colour.
The original readme follows below.

# Mc-OS-themes
(Formerly known as Gnome-OSC-themes) 

This is a repository that contains Mac OS-themes for the Linux-Gnome desktop made by PaulXFCE (myself)

These are high end and thorougly developed GTK-themes for the gnome desktop (3.20+ through 3.28) that interpretes the Mac Os themes to the gnome-environment. 

In the latest version (McOS-MJV)  I've modernized it in every little detail. There is nothing (not a single item) that is not new. Resulting in a completely rewritten GTK.CSS-file.  it also contains the dark-mode (for applications that use it)

The dark-mode is also available as a seperate theme (McOS-MJV-Dark-Mode), which has the benifit of having GTK2-applications enjoy the same dark mode. 
 
## McOS-MJV

This is a gnome-interpretation of the Mac OS Mojave (TM) desktop, with the benifit of the dark mode

## How to install:

First: Download the file; extract it; and somethimes you will find two themes. a version with transparency, another with (not-transparent); copy both files to a '.themes'-folder you make in your home directory. Or to your USR/SHARE/THEMES-folder for system-wide use (certainly for theming of SNAP-packages)
Then use Tweak-tool to select the GTK and shell theme.
LOG OUT AND BACK IN for changes to take effect !

Second: McOS uses titlebuttons on the left-side:
To put the buttons to the left open a terminal:

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout "close,minimize,maximize:"

To put the buttons back to the right in case you want to revert:

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout ":minimize,maximize,close"

In Gnome 3.26+ gnome-tweak has a option to change the position of the titlebuttons, so the above steps are not necessary. 

## Troubleshouting

When, as such, theming does not look the way it should be: make sure you have installed the necessary theme-"engines":

- The gnome-themes-standard package,
- The murrine engine. This has different names depending on your distro.
gtk-engine-murrine (Arch Linux)
gtk2-engines-murrine (Debian, Ubuntu, elementary OS)
gtk-murrine-engine (Fedora)
gtk2-engine-murrine (openSUSE)
gtk-engines-murrine (Gentoo)

sudo apt-get install gtk2-engines-pixbuf is the terminal command, usually solves the issues with GTK2.
